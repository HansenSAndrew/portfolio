            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            When I started my college career, I was originally going to be an IT major.
            In my hometown of South Boston, VA, I was trained at the SVHEC for IT. However,
            James Madison University did not have that major at that time, so I changed to
            Computer Science and have not looked back since. I am now a software engineer who
            enjoys making programs and solving problems.

            I worked at a computer repair shop, and I had multiple responsibilities including:
            managing clients, running house calls, and doing tech support over the phone. I
            repaired a multitude of desktops, laptops, industrial computers, and networks.
