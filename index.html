    <div class="About">
        <p>
            I was raised in Halifax, Virginia, with five siblings. At a young age, I was
            interested in computers, so much so that my brother and I built a computer
            when we were teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am unemployed. However, I am hoping to get into the game
            development industry. I will soon begin work on a personal project
            that uses the Unity Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            My other interests include playing musical instruments, watching
            basketball, and video creation.
