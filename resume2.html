            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Halifax, VA, with limited computing possibilities. My brother and I built a computer when we
            were teenagers, and I began to learn how to program from that experience. Since then, I have gained interest
            in software engineering, specifically game design and web applications.

            a database of either books or movies.
