This was my first project with Django, Postgres, and React. My team and I created a dynamic website that had an intricate backend with an elegant frontend. These tools are most haves for web development. Using a SQL language, like Postgres, is incredibly useful for a dynamic website.",

But, this project gave me an appreciation for C and Assembly. It also gave me a deeper understanding on how computer hardware manipulates data.
